    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a distribution of Python and R for scientific computing and data science. It includes a lot of packages and tools for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).\n",
    "2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n",
    "3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.\n",

    "#### Commands to Check Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda --version\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using VS code for this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful code editor that you use use easily for your data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more compliers used by professionals, recommended one is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installation Guide\n",

    "1. Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n",
    "3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you can open VS Code and start coding!\n",
    "1. Go to the Extensions view by clicking the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.\n",
    "2. Install the Python and Jupyter extensions.\n",
    "3. From the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), select `Python: Select Interpreter` and choose the Conda environment.\n",

    "## 2. Creating and Activating Conda Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating and using Conda environments is a best practice to manage project-specific dependencies in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Create a Conda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new Conda environment, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `myenv` with the name you want for your environment. You can also specify Python version and packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name myenv python=3.8 ipython\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Activate the Conda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the newly created environment, use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 2.3 List existing Conda Enviroments \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda info --envs\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 2.4 Deactivate the Conda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done working in the environment, you can deactivate it with:\n",
